# bummer - let's fail to hide our failures
your failures are probably as interesting as your accomplishments.

<a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/bummer?utm_source=badge-featured&utm_medium=badge&utm_souce=badge-bummer" target="_blank"><img src="https://api.producthunt.com/widgets/embed-image/v1/featured.svg?post_id=352500&theme=light" alt="bummer - Let&#0039;s&#0032;fail&#0032;to&#0032;hide&#0032;our&#0032;failures | Product Hunt" style="width: 250px; height: 54px;" width="250" height="54" /></a> 

bummer is all about failures.

I created bummer because I wanted a place to list all my failures at one place, so I can look back and review them easily.

## TODO
- create an embeddable widget like ProductHunt widget above
- add download options pdf, png
- add profile image uploader

Contributions are welcome.
